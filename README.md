## My React Portfolio

## https://danielpruitt.github.io/reactportfolio/ 
I'm Daniel Pruitt and I'm a passionate web developer that's adept at learning new languages. I love a problem solving and a good challenge. I started my journey in coding and web development teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was a long journey and I didn't feel like I was going anywhere fast. A door opened up to join the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp so I took it. It was the perfect program for me and propelled my coding skill exponentially. I graduated the program in October of 2018 and have been looking forward to my dream career in web development and design.

This portfolio highlights projects that I have done for the Georgia Tech Bootcamp and highlights several different skills. It was built with React and the Materialize CSS libraries.
